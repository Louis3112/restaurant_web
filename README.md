My Mid-Semester Project for Platform-Oriented Programming (POP) in 4th Semester.
Platform-Oriented Programming is an approach to software development where the code is synced with the characteristics of target platform.
On this project, the code is synced with the characteristics of website platform (HTML,CSS,JS)

The project is a simple restaurant web called Depot Accord. Depot Accord is inspired by *my parents's street small chinese restaurant.* 
Depot Accord is the reason i can grow up, go to school, and pursue my educational goals. So that's why i *'immortalize'* them in this project.

The website page provide a list of foods that are being sold in Depot Accord,
The foods are categorized in 2 section:
  1. Fried Foods
    - Fried Rice
    - Fried Noodle
    - Fried Kway Teow
    - Fried Rice Noodle
    - Fried Dumplings
    - Egg Foo Yong
    - Koloke
  2. Non Fried Foods
    - Chinese Noodle
    - Kway Teow Soup
    - Rice Noodle Soup
    - Cap Cai
    - Fried Dumplings Soup
    - Indo-Chinese Chicken Noodle 

and Drinks:
    - Mineral Water
    - Tea
    - Iced Orange
    - Coconut Water

The user can input the number of foods and items they want to buy, and a JavaScript function will calculate the total price for the food.
There is also a transition whether you input the number and click order on the top right of the website.

The primary color palette i am using are :
1. #c60b0b
2. #f5f5f5
3. #000000
