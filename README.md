My Mid-Semester Project for Platform-Oriented Programming (POP) in 4th Semester.
Platform-Oriented Programming is an approach to software development where the code is synced with the characteristics of target platform.
On this project, the code is synced with the characteristics of website platform (HTML,CSS,JS)

The project is a simple restaurant web called Depot Accord. Depot Accord is inspired by *my parents's street small chinese restaurant.* 
Depot Accord is the reason i can grow up, go to school, and pursue my educational goals. So that's why i *'immortalize'* them in this project.

The website page provide a list of foods that are being sold in Depot Accord,
The foods and drinks are categorized in 3 section:
  1. Fried Foods
     - Fried Rice_______________________ *(Nasi Goreng)*
     - Fried Noodle___________________ *(Mie Goreng)*
     - Fried Kway Teow_________________ *(Kwetiau Goreng)*
     - Fried Rice Noodle_______________ *(Bihun Goreng)*
     - Fried Dumplings__________________ *(Pangsit Goreng)*
     - Egg Foo Yong____________________ *(Fuyunghai)*
     - Koloke____________________________ *(Koloke)*
    
  2. Non Fried Foods
     - Chinese Noodle___________________ *(Mie Kuah)*
     - Kway Teow Soup________________ *(Kwetiau Kuah)*
     - Rice Noodle Soup______________ *(Bihun Kuah)*
     - Cap Cai_______________________ *(Cap Jay)*
     - Fried Dumplings Soup___________ *(Pangsit Kuah)*
     - Indo-Chinese Chicken Noodle___ *(Mie Ayam)*

  3. Drinks
     - Mineral Water__________________ *(Air Putih)*
     - Tea__________________________ *(Teh)*
     - Iced Orange___________________ *(Es Jeruk)*
     - Coconut Water________________ *(Es Degan)*

The user can input the number of foods and items they want to buy, and a JavaScript function will calculate the total price for the food.
There is also a transition whether you input the number and click order on the top right of the website.

The primary color palette i am using are :
